## Handwritten Digit Classification (`mnist`)

Deep learning architecture comparison using digit recognition as the learning problem. 

### Architectures

The repository makes use of the following architectures deep learning architectures:

- Feedforward Networks (MLPs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transformer-based Architectures

### Training Techniques (TODO)

- Learning Rate Scheduler
- Gradient Accumulation
- Gradient Checkpointing
- Layer Freezing
- Knowledge Distillation
